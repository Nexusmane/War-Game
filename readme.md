# The Game of War

Welcome to the game of [War](https://nexusmane.github.io/War-Game/)! 

## About

This game is something I played a lot as a child, as it's very simple and quick. All you need to play is a deck of cards and a second person. The premise of the game is that each player will draw a card and the higher face value wins. The rules are broken down more below in the 'Rules' section.

## Technologies Used

#### For this game I used 3 common technologies:

1. HTML - for basic layout and content
2. Javascript - for functionality and logic
3. CSS - for styling and a more specific layout


## Rules of the Game/Getting Started - Click [Here](https://nexusmane.github.io/War-Game/) to Launch Game.

### The rules are as follows:

1. The deck is shuffled into two piles, one for each player.
2. Each player then draws the top card off the deck and places it in the center. 
3. The higher card wins the bout, both cards will then be put into the discard pile.
    - Each battle won is worth 1 point, unless there is a tie. 
    - If a tie occurs, both plays must discard 3 more cards, and draw a fourth to battle again. Winner takes all the points! (This tie process may repeat if another tie occurs during a "War")
4. Once both player's decks have been exhuasted of cards, the player with more points will be delcared the winner!


## Future Enhancements

#### For future updates there's a few things I'd like to encorporate into this game. 

1. Custom styling
    - This would pertain to different card styles, username input's for both sides, and even a full theme potentially for the play area. 
2. More detailed logic
    - I would like to switch up the logic to be slightly more traditional in the long run. Instead of only playing 26 cards and earning points, I would switch to the method of winning cards. 
    - This allows the winner to put the two cards from the battle they won, back into their deck. This will create a more suspenseful and much longer game, the one I more commonly played as a child. 
3. Multiplayer functionality
    - In the long run I think I'd love to add a multiplayer mode that allows for up to 4 players. This was a variant I enjoyed playing a lot as a kid. It makes the game much more interesting.
