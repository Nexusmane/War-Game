<!-- *~----------------- Pseudo Code -----------------~*

1. Set up play space (Let HTML and CSS create game space) 
    a. Create place reset and 'War' buttons to handle resetting and playing cards. 
    a. Initialize deck 
        - shuffle deck with shuffle function
    b. Use 'Deal' function to distribute shuffled deck into 2 new arrays (Creates 2 new array objects)
        - *Or create new random array from shuffled deck and relabel remaining cards as p2Deck

2. Allow player(s) to click on "war" to start the game  
    a. on click the war button will initial several functions.
        - First, grab a random card from each of the two arrays
        - Insert new array item into play field on corresponding side
        - Compare choices function will run to compare values
            ~ If choices are exact same, ---  #4.
        - Win condition checked for round played    
        - cards played are then stored in playedCards array
        - Player with higher card is given +1 value to points

3. After each round is played, value of two deck arrays are checked.
    a. Once both arrays return empty
    b. Player points are checked
        - Higher points will be declared winner
        - Then promopted to reset to play again

4. If cards are identical, proceed with tie function 
    a. Tie function inserts 3 random cards from each of the two deck arrays into cardsPLayed array
    b. Tie function then runs draw function to simulate the last card being played 
        - this function essentially gets rid of the facedown cards being played, discarding them from both decks
